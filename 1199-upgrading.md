Todo:
- Provide specific examples of how one component upgrade influence another component upgrade
-->
There are a number of software components in the Juju universe that can be upgraded. Please visit the page dedicated to the task you're interested in.

-   [Upgrading a machine series](/t/upgrading-a-machine-series/1198)
    This affects the series (release) of the underlying operating system of a Juju machine, including a controller.
-   [Upgrading models](/t/upgrading-models/1154)
    This affects the version of Juju running on a Juju machine in the form of machine agents and unit agents.
-   [Upgrading applications](/t/upgrading-applications/1080)
    This affects the version of an already deployed charm.
-   [Upgrading the client](/t/client/1083#heading--client-upgrades)
    This affects the version of the Juju client.

There is no inherent reason to upgrade components at the same time or to upgrade components in a specific order. What often dictates an upgrade is a desired feature in a new version of one component. This may, either before or after, necessitate the upgrade of another component.
