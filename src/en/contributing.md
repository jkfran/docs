# Contributing

The [Juju documentation][juju-docs] web site has now ceased to use
[GitHub][github-juju-docs]. Its holding and editing place is now in a
[Discourse][juju-discourse]
forum.

This means that forum members will be able to edit/create documentation pages
themselves, according to the [trust level][discourse-trust-level] system built
into Discourse. Because the web site will be updated automatically, the docs
have effectively become a wiki.

The documentation now resides under the [Docs][discourse-docs] category. There
is a pinned topic that acts as the [table of contents][discourse-docs-toc]. The
sub-category [Docs-discuss][discourse-docs-discuss] is to be used for
documentation-related subjects (stuff that is not intended to be published on
the web site).

Documentation issues are still managed by this GitHub repository however.

This transition occurred on March 14, 2019. Please see Discourse topic
[Documentation migrated to Discourse][discourse-docs-migration]
for more information on how the new system works.

Thank you for your interest in Juju documentation.
