Title: Applications

# Applications

An *application* is a piece of software that is installed via a *charm*. These
two terms are often used interchangeably.

## Application management

Common application management tasks are summarised below.

The most important ones are [Deploying applications][charms-deploying] and
[Managing relations][charms-relations].


^# Application groups
   
   See the [Application groups][charms-groups] page for full information.


^# Application high availability
   
   See the [Application high availability][charms-ha] page for full information.


^# Application metrics
   
   See the [Application metrics][charms-metrics] page for full information.


^# Configure applications
   
   See the [Configuring applications][charms-config] page for full
   information.


^# Deploy applications
  
   The [Deploying applications][charms-deploying] page covers an array of
   methods for getting your applications deployed.
  
   The [Deploying applications - advanced][charms-deploying] page contains more
   advanced use cases.
  
   See the [Deploying charms offline][charms-offline-deploying] page for
   guidance when deploying in a network-restricted environment.

   Applications can be deployed and configured as a collection of charms. The
   [Charm bundles][charms-bundles] page shows how this is done.
 

^# Relate applications
  
   The [Managing relations][charms-relations] page provides a full
   explanation and includes examples.
