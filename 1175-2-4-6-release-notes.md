<h2 id="heading--get-juju">Get Juju</h2>

The easiest way to install Juju is by using the `snap` package:

      sudo snap install juju --classic

Those already using the 'stable' snap channel (the default as per the above command) should be upgraded automatically. Other packages are available for a variety of platforms (see the [install documentation](/t/installing-juju/1164)).
