The Juju team is pleased to announce the release of Juju 2.4.2.

This is primarily a bug fix release. In particular, it changes the default series for controllers from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic).

For the full list of fixes and additions, see the [2.4.2 milestone](https://launchpad.net/juju/+milestone/2.4.2).

The easiest way to install Juju is by using the `snap` package:

      sudo snap install juju --classic

Those already using the 'stable' snap channel (the default as per the above command) should be upgraded automatically. Other packages are available for a variety of platforms (see the [install documentation](/t/installing-juju/1164)).
