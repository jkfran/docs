The Juju team is pleased to announce the release of Juju 2.4.1.

This is primarily a bug fix release. In particular, it contains a fix for a critical issue involving the removal of Juju binaries on units. However, there are also a few new features such as support for the upcoming Ubuntu 18.10 (Cosmic) release as well as constraints for the LXD provider. For the full list of fixes and additions, see the [2.4.1 milestone](https://launchpad.net/juju/+milestone/2.4.1).

If you were affected by any of the bugs fixed in this release, your feedback is appreciated. Please contact the Juju team using the communication channels specified in the feedback section.
