**Details:**

Juju provides agent software to every machine it creates. This command upgrades that software across an entire model, which is, by default, the current model.

A model's agent version can be shown with `juju model-config agent- version`.

A version is denoted by: major.minor.patch The upgrade candidate will be auto-selected if `--agent-version` is not specified:

      - If the server major version matches the client major version, the
      version selected is minor+1. If such a minor version is not available then
      the next patch version is chosen.

      - If the server major version does not match the client major version,
      the version selected is that of the client version.
If the controller is without internet access, the client must first supply the software to the controller's cache via the `juju sync-agent-binaries` command. The command will abort if an upgrade is in progress. It will also abort if a previous upgrade was not fully completed (e.g.: if one of the controllers in a high availability model failed to upgrade).

When looking for an agent to upgrade to Juju will check the currently configured agent stream for that model. It's possible to overwrite this for the lifetime of this upgrade using `--agent-stream` If a failed upgrade has been resolved, `--reset-previous-upgrade` can be used to allow the upgrade to proceed.

Backups are recommended prior to upgrading.

**Examples:**

       juju upgrade-model --dry-run
        juju upgrade-model --agent-version 2.0.1
        juju upgrade-model --agent-stream proposed
