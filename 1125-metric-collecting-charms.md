Adding metrics to a charm is simple and straightforward with the reactive framework. For a general overview of metrics see [Application metrics](/t/application-metrics/1067).

<h2 id="heading--add-layermetrics">Add layer:metrics</h2>

Add `layer:metrics` to the charmâ€™s `layer.yaml`. This layer provides the [`collect-metrics`](/t/charm-hooks/1040#heading--collect-metrics) hook, and allows metric collection to be defined completely by `metrics.yaml`.

<h2 id="heading--add-metricsyaml">Add metrics.yaml</h2>

Declare the metrics to be collected in your charm's `metrics.yaml`. Example:

``` yaml
metrics:
  users:
    type: gauge
    description: Number of users
  tokens:
    type: gauge
    description: Number of active tokens
```

<h3 id="heading--metric-types">Metric types</h3>

Only `type: gauge` fully supports operational use-cases. Other types are experimental.

<h4 id="heading--type-gauge">`type: gauge`</h4>

Gauge metrics are a snapshot value reading at a point in time, as a positive decimal number.

<h4 id="heading--type-absolute">`type: absolute`</h4>

Absolute metrics track the quantity since the last measurement, as a positive decimal number. Future releases of Juju will track the cumulative aggregate of absolutes, providing a more useful indicator to operators.

<h4 id="heading--built-in-metric-juju-units">Built-in metric `juju-units`</h4>

There is also a built-in metric, which has no type or description, named `juju-units`. When declared, this metric sends a "1" for each unit.

<h2 id="heading--metric-commands">Metric commands</h2>

When charming with `layer:metrics`, add a `command:` attribute to each metric in `metrics.yaml`, containing a command line that measures the value when executed. `layer:metrics` will then execute this command in the `collect-metrics` hook for you automatically. Continuing with the example above:

``` yaml
metrics:
  users:
    type: gauge
    description: Number of users
    command: scripts/count_users.py
  tokens:
    type: gauge
    description: Number of active tokens
    command: scripts/count_tokens.py
```

Commands can use any script or executable in your charm or installed elsewhere on the workload. The current working directory for this command will be the charm directory (`charmhelpers.core.hookenv.charm_dir`). The command must write only the metric value to standard output, and terminate with exit code 0 in order for the measurement to be to be counted valid.

Continuing with the metrics example above, a charm that relates to a PostgreSQL database probably stores its "users" and "tokens" in database tables. These can be counted with a simple SQL query. `scripts/count_users.py` in such a charm might read as:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# Python packages will have been installed by the charm.
import configparser
import psycopg2


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Read the application's configuration file, which will have been written
    # by the charm's relation hooks.
    with open('/opt/sso-auth/config.ini') as f:
        config_str = f.read()
    config = configparser.ConfigParser(strict=False)
    config.read_string(config_str)

    # Build a database connection string from configuration.
    dbname = config['database']['NAME']
    user = config['database']['USER']
    password = config['database']['PASSWD']
    hostport = config['database']['HOST']
    host, port = hostport.split(':')
    conn_str = 'dbname=%s user=%s password=%s host=%s port=%s' % (
        dbname, user, password, host, port)
    conn = psycopg2.connect(conn_str)
    try:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        try:
            # For sake of example, let's say we don't want to include the
            # default admin user account in the count.
            cur.execute("SELECT COUNT(1) FROM users WHERE name != 'admin';")
            row, = cur.fetchone()
            print(row)  # Print the measurement to standard output, for Juju
        finally:
            cur.close()
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

Note that this command will not have access to the normal lifecycle hook environment. Refer to the [`collect-metrics`](/t/charm-hooks/1040#heading--collect-metrics) documentation for more information.
