Hello,

first of all I would like to thank you for all wonderful juju project. I am deploying Openstack with juju and maas and so far from my experience I know that by using simple KVM on nova-compute nodes performance is much slower than using docker inside nova-compute nodes. It used to be a novadocker driver to use docker properly on compute nodes [https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Docker](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Docker). Now project is not longer maintained, but I still need nova-docker for my compute nodes. For today it is alternative to use Zun [https://opendev.org/openstack/zun/src/branch/master/README.rst](https://opendev.org/openstack/zun/src/branch/master/README.rst) , but as far as I know juju does not support Zun charm. Does juju offers solution to achieve this?
